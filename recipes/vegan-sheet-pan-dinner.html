    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Vegan Sheet Pan Dinner with herbed potato, asparagus and chickpeas is
      roasted to perfection and so easy to make using one pan with a few
      ingredients and is full of flavor!
    </p>
    <p>
      This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you want something hearty,
      nutritious, fuss-free and on the table in under an hour. It’s also great
      for meal prepping and can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 / 6
      days.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb. baby red potatoes, sliced in half lengthwise</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups petite baby carrots</li>
      <li>1 can (14oz.) chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
      <li>
        1 teaspoon of EACH dried basil, dried thyme, dried oregano (see notes)
      </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 – 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 lb. asparagus, ends trimmed and cut into thirds</li>
      <li>1/2 large yellow onion, sliced lengthwise</li>
      <li>mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment
        paper, silpat or lightly grease with oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble: Add the potatoes, carrots and chickpeas to the sheet pan,
        drizzle with 1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil and 3/4 of the spices, toss to
        coat. Arrange the potatoes flesh side down, this will help them get
        crispy edges.
      </li>
      <li>Roast: Place in the oven for 20 -25 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Add onion + asparagus: Carefully remove the pan from the oven, push the
        potato mixture to one side, add the onion and asparagus, add the
        remaining oil and herb/spice mix, toss to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue roasting: Place sheet pan back in the oven and roast for 10 –
        15 minutes more. Let cool a few minutes before serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve: Place in individual serving bowls and top with parsley sprinkled
        over top and sliced avocado on the side. Would be great with a serving
        of quinoa on the side as well, adding more fiber and protein!
