This is my first practical assignment on The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/) 's Foundation Course.
Despite having practical experience with both HTML and CSS, I thought it would be fun to follow a systematic approach 
to publish my projects in Github.

The pages are very barebones HTML simulating recipe websites, with no CSS, return links, navigation bar, styling, footers, etc.
I hope to revisit this and add some CSS, styling and quality-of-life improvements.
